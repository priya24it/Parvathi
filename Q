I dropped one schema and the corresponding data file in the host bucket. I also uploaded a trigger file in the trigger bucket. Since there are no DDM columns, schema setup was not required. However, when I ran the DAG, it failed with the error mentioned below. Upon analysis, it was found that the job was looking for an entry in the test-setup.yaml file. I added the entry to the test-setup.yaml file with count testing, and the job passed successfully, with the data being loaded as expected. Could you please clarify if the job is expected to fail in such cases, or should it display an informational message about missing test configurations instead?
