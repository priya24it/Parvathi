This is a special scenario that occurs when a given partition date has only one file (data plus schema). This can be handled by addressing the None value as shown below. However, I believe this is a rare scenario. When a partition date has multiple files, the job runs successfully even if one of the files is missing a test configuration setup. However, the corresponding informational message is missing in this case. This happens because, when the test result is not present in the test results dictionary, it directly returns at this point.
