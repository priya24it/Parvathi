I am unable to interpret the data or process it exactly as mentioned in the file. I believe there might be an implementation document available to understand it better. All the provided tables have an equal number of 391 rows, with most columns being identical except for the rowID column. While the other columns match, the rowID column varies. Could you clarify how to interpret the rowID column in this context?
